## Thank you!

Really appreciate that you've come this far checking out my project. I'd like to give special credit to Harvard CS50 course instructor David J. Malan, Angela Yu (App brewery full stack web dev bootcamp) and Jonas Schmedtmann (advanced CSS and advanced JS courses) who've all taught me things along the way that helped me build this project today. Take care and I'll see you on the next one! :)
